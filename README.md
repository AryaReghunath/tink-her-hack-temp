#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)
Architecture Overview:

BudgetShield follows a client-side architecture:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Data Storage: Browser localStorage

Visualization: Chart.js library

Data Flow:

User inputs expenses.

Data stored in localStorage.

Dashboard retrieves data.

Charts update dynamically.

UI reflects real-time analytics.

If they require a diagram, draw a simple block diagram:

User → Browser UI → JavaScript Logic → localStorage → Chart.js Visualization


**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](docs/workflow.png)
User signs up and sets monthly budget.

User is redirected to dashboard.

User selects or creates month.

User enters categorized expenses.

System calculates totals and balance.

Charts update automatically.

User views analytics and trends.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)
Tool Used: ChatGPT

Purpose:

UI improvement suggestions

Debugging JavaScript

Chart integration assistance

Documentation formatting

Human Contributions:

Project architecture design

Expense categorization logic

UI customization

Feature integration

Testing and optimization


**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]
Chatgpt ,claude Ai,VS Coder 


**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
-Debugging JavaScript logic and error handling

Assistance in integrating Chart.js visualizations

UI/UX improvement suggestions (layout, spacing, responsiveness)

Structuring localStorage data handling

Documentation formatting and README structuri

**Key Prompts Used:**
"Help integrate Chart.js pie and bar charts into a financial dashboard"

"Debug this JavaScript function for updating dynamic charts"

"Improve the UI styling for a glassmorphism dashboard layout"

"How to manage month-based expense tracking using localStorage"

"Structure professional project documentation for a hackathon submission"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]
Approximately 30–35%
AI was primarily used for:

Debugging assistance

Refining UI elements

Documentation support

Core logic, feature decisions, architecture design, and final integration were implemented manually.

**Human Contributions:**
System architecture planning

Designing multi-page flow (Login → Dashboard → Analytics)

Implementing categorized expense tracking

Developing month-based comparison logic

Integrating authentication flow using localStorage

Customizing and styling UI components

Testing, debugging, and feature refinement

Feature ideation and user workflow design

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
